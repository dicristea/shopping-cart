## Project: Shopping Cart

A shopping cart experience created using ReactJS! Here, I explore the usage and implementation of lifecycle methods using hooks and state. The project is inspired by The Odin Project curriculum.

## Features

- Scoreboard shows your score of the current round, and a "Best Score" showing the best score achieved thus far.
- Image cards are redisplayed in a random order anytime a user selects one.

## Todos

- Make UI more responsive for phone screens --> css media queries
- Use useContext rather than prop drilling

## What I learned

- working with state and understanding when I could use hooks (API keys, endpoints, error handling)
