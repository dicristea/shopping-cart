## Project: Shopping Cart

A shopping cart experience created using ReactJS! Here, I explore the usage and implementation of lifecycle methods using hooks and state. The project is inspired by The Odin Project curriculum.

## Features

- Home, About, Catalong, and Shopping Cart pages with easy UI navigation
- Sticky Navgation Bar shopping bag icon displays quantity of items currently in the cart
- Custom input for quanitity increment and decrement, readonly
- Maximum 5 of one item can be in the cart.
- On submitting an order or editting the cart, the amount in the cart and order summary adjusts, as well at the total price
- Can remove items quickly from the cart via 'x'

## Todos

- Hover labels on all Icon Buttons
- Use react routing rather to update URL on navigation to different pages.
- Use useContext rather than prop drilling
- "Proceed to Checkout" is currently inactive.

## What I learned

- Using "body::before" alongside a sticky nav bar for full page background image
  Check: <a href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/why-does-body-before-code-work-and-not-body/350130">Freecodecamp Article</a>
- Using an object as a data structure for easy configuration of catalog and shopping cart information.
- Using Object.keys(), Object.values() to return array of just those values.
- working with state and understanding when to use useEffect to update only parts of a page
- Practiced Git workflow: Git branching, github pull requests, editting commits
- Practiced using array methods, spread syntax, inline styling, media queries
